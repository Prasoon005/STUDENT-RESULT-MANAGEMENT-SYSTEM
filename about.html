            <div class="tech-container">
                <div class="tech-item">
                    <h3>HTML</h3>
                    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the structure of the webpage, including elements like headings, paragraphs, forms, and tables. It's the foundation that supports the content of the Student Marks Management System.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tech-item">
                    <h3>CSS</h3>
                    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling the webpage. It controls the layout, colors, and positioning of elements. Transitions and animations in CSS were used to enhance the user interface and make the page more interactive.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tech-item">
                    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                    <p>JavaScript adds interactivity to the system. It handles the logic for submitting student marks, calculating totals, and dynamically updating the results table. This makes the system functional and user-friendly.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tech-item">
                    <h3>Figma</h3>
